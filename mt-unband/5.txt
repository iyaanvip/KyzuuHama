To WhatsApp Support Team,

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am following up on my previous request regarding the reactivation of my WhatsApp account linked to the number +{nomer}. I have not yet received a response and would like to kindly ask for an update on the status of my request.

As previously mentioned, I rely on this account for important personal and professional communication. Its deactivation has caused a considerable disruption in my daily activities.

I respectfully ask for your assistance in reviewing my case and helping me restore access to my account. If further information or verification is required, I am ready to provide it.

Thank you once again for your attention and support. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Renn
